1) The logic should allow the user to enter as many
records as they wish, computer Gross Payu and Net Pay.
Write the data to the data file, Personel.dat.  Put a single
 blank between each data field to as as a default delimiter.

2) Retrieve each record.  Read a record and check for the EOF.  Since you really don't
know how many records are in the data file, use a while loop.
The loop will read the record at the end of the loop

3) Paginate the output information.

Be sure to format appropriate values as currency.  See if you can
format the hours as decimal with 1 decimal position (i.e. 40 hours
as 40.0 hours).  Use a While loop around the main logic to let the
user keep adding or reading instead of one pass through the entire
program logic.
